		<pre>
			Hello there and welcome to my website!
			I graduated from Dunman Secondary School in 2016.
			Currently studying at <a href="https://www.tp.edu.sg/" target="_blank">Temasek Polytechnic Singapore</a>,
			completing my Diploma in Computer Engineering.
			I love to study interesting stuff and like to tinker with tech I learn!
			Always involved in lots of projects and competitions/hackathons!

			<span style="font-weight: bold;">My Story?  :)</span>
				- I was born and raised in Singapore in a Chinese family.
				- As part of the curriculum of the secondary school I went to, we needed to read a
				  book everyday for 20mins in the morning, and this was what started me on my journey.
				- My interest in electronics begin when I read a book (I forgot what was the book's title)
				  and it talked about the foxhole radio and the line, "the foxhole radio does not need any
				  power to operate", that really got my interest. I was really amazed at the concept of
				  wireless power/data transmission and started to learn more about radios by reading
				  up on them. If you know, as foxhole radio is a radio that does not need any power to
				  operate, because it operates entirely off the power of the radio waves in the air.
				  That amazed me because I never heard of something that is entirely wirelessly
				  powered before. I decided to try and build my very own foxhole radio and through
				  that process my interest in electronics grew and I started to delve deeper into
				  it and started learning about arduino as my first microcontroller.
				- Found my mentor online, at that time he was a undergrad from NUS doing a <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/nusbulletin/other-multidisciplinaryspecial-programmes/double-degree-programmes/double-degree-in-computer-science-and-mathematics-applied-mathematics/">degree</a>
				  in Computer Science and Math. Started learning C programming from him and started
				  delving into competitve programming with the UVA online judge.
				- Since then I have been constantly learning more about programming and electronics
				  and started doing interesting DIY <a href="/projects.html">projects</a> on my own.

			<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tech and tech stack I am currently working on</span>
				- Backend Web developement in NodeJS and backend systems architecture.
				- Building and migrating towards scalable systems combining Events
				  with Microservices architecture using Kafka for my WebApps.
				- Application Optimization for embedded system applications

			<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tech that I am interested to learn and work with</span>
				- Distributed systems
				- Systems architecture design, esp. distributed computing systems.
				- Future of backend web developement like Go, gRPC, HTTP/2  streaming tech.
				- Stream/event based programming/software-design
				- Asynchronous Software
				- Resource scheduling on embedded devices as part of my project to create
				  my own Bootloader or Basic OS for different microcontrollers.

			<!-- Perhaps for the below portions, I should publish all these articles to github-->
			<!-- In the guthub for the review thing, remember to add in the name of the book and the ISBN -->
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">Below are some of the articles and other stuff I am working on</span>
				<span style="font-weight: bold;">Book summary / review</span>
				- <a href="#">The Business Book</a>

				<span style="font-weight: bold;">My Recommended Books List</span>  (Note that it is randomly ordered)
				- <a href="#">The criminal biology</a>
					- A book on the relationship between crime and biology.
					- A book that talks about some uncomfortable yet scientifically provable ideas.
					- Really helped me change me view of the world by alot.
					- Can be quite a shocking book for some people as the information presented
					  may not always be put in a nice way or politically correct. A really nice straight
					  forward book writing style that I think quite alot of people can appreciate.
				- <a href="#">The Business Book</a>
					- On basic building ideas of business and management skills.
					- Great book to learn about many new topics, as they are all catergorised into
					  neat little chunks of info with examples.
				- <a href="#">The liberal investing</a>
					- On investing and liberal arts.
					- It talks about how investing is similiar to the other processes in the world
					  and how learning more things in all areas and fields can help you gain more
					  insights in all aspects of your life and become a better investor.
				- <a href="#">F.U Money</a>
					- Life changing book on the success mindset by Dan Lok.
